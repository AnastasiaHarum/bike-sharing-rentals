# Bike Rentals - Final Project "Belajar Analisis Data Dengan Python"

This final project from Dicoding's "Belajar Analisis Data Dengan Python" course focuses on analyzing a bike-sharing dataset and creating a dashboard. In the notebook, I demonstrate the process of analysis, including Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualization. Additionally, I built a dashboard using Streamlit, which you can access via the link in the right sidebar [here](https://bike-sharing-rentals.streamlit.app/).

For further information, like the background of this dataset, dataset characteristics, file structures, and more, you can check out the `Readme` file. So in here, I won't explain it any further.

## 2. Project work cycle
1. Data Wrangling: 
 - Gathering data
 - Assessing data
 - Cleaning data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
 - Defined business questions for data exploration
 - Create Data exploration
3. Data Visualization:
 - Create Data Visualization that answer business questions
4. Dashboard:
 - Set up the DataFrame which will be used
 - Make filter components on the dashboard
 - Complete the dashboard with various data visualizations

**Note: Numbers 1 to 3 are in the dicoding-collection-exercise and number 4 is in dashboard.**

## 3. Getting Started
### `Notebook_Bike_Sharing_Rentals.ipynb`
1. Download the Project: Download the project files "Notebook_Bike_Sharing_Rentals.ipynb".
2. Open Your Favorite IDE: You can use any IDE you prefer, like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory (for this tutorial, we'll use Google Colab).
3. Create a New Notebook: Open Google Colab -> Click on File and select New notebook -> Upload the .ipynb.
4. Run the Code Cells: Once the notebook is loaded, run each code cell by clicking the play icon next to the cell or using Shift + Enter.

### `dashboard/dashboard.py`
1. Download the project: 
2. Install the Streamlit in your terminal or command prompt using `pip install streamlit`. Install another libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and seaborn if you haven't.
3. Please note, don't move the csv file because it acts a data source. keep it in one folder as dashboard.py
4. Open your VSCode and run the file by clicking the terminal and write it `streamlit run dashboard.py`.
